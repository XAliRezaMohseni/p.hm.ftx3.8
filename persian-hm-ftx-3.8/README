The Persian HM-FTX bundle of fonts offers a set of 240 Persian fonts which are
derived from the Metafont sources provided in the FarsiTeX distribution,
farsitex-1.0pre1, released in 2004 by Behdad Esfahbod and the accredited Irmug
font software http://wiki.irmug.com/index.php/X_Series_2.

The conversion from Metafont to TrueType has been done by a python program
which copies the glyphs from each FarsiTeX font and pastes them to the
corresponding font provided in X Series 2 fonts released by Behnam at
irmug.com. However, before conversion, the following modifications were applied
to X Series 2 fonts:

   - the solid dot shape zero, ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO (uni06F0),
     is changed to hollow circular zero.

   - the glyphs with YEH ABOVE are changed to the glyphs with HAMZA ABOVE,
     e.g. ARABIC LETTER HEH WITH YEH ABOVE ISOLATED FORM (uni06C2) has been
     changed to ARABIC LETTER HEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE ISOLATED FORM.

   - the position and height of the following glyphs are fixed:
     emdash (uni2014), endash (uni2013), hyphenlow (uni2010), and
     hyphentwo (NA).

   - the Persian thousands separator (066C) and the Persian decimal
     separator (066B) are fixed. 

   - the following glyphs in HM_XKayhan, HM_XKayhanBd, HM_XKayhanBdIt,
     HM_XKayhanIt, HM_XKayhanNavaar, HM_XKayhanPook, and HM_XKayhanSayeh are
     modified :
     exclam (uni0021), comma (uni002C), semicolon (uni003B),
     quotesinglbase (uni201A), quotedblbase (uni201E), quoteleft (uni2018),
     quoteright (uni2019), quotedblleft (uni201C), quotedblright (uni201D),
     exclamdown (uni00A1), decimalseparatorpersian (NA),
     thousandsseparatorpersian (NA), apostrophemod (uni02BC),
     afii64937 (uni02BD), afii57388 (uni060C), uni060D,
     afii57403 (uni061B), uni066C, quotereversed (uni201B),
     quotedblreversed (uni201F).

   - the problem with copying text from an Adobe PDF file and pasting
     it into another file is fixed.

   - the problem with substituting period with uni066C (ARABIC
     THOUSANDS SEPARATOR) in the following font families is fixed:
     HM_XKayhan, HM_XKhorramshahr, HM_XNiloofar, HM_XPaatch, HM_XRiyaz,
     HM_XRoya, HM_XShafigh, HM_XShafighKurd, HM_XShafighUzbek, HM_XShiraz,
     HM_XSols, HM_XTabriz, HM_XTitr, HM_XTraffic, HM_XVosta, HM_XYaghut,
     HM_XYas, HM_XZar

   - the problem with substituting period with uni066B (ARABIC DECIMAL
     SEPARATOR) in the following font families is fixed:
     HM_XVosta, HM_XYekan, HM_XYermook.

   - the problem with substituting period with decimalseparatorpersian
     in the font family HM_XZiba is fixed.

   - the problem with substituting uniFEEB+afii301 with uni06BE
     is fixed.

   - the problem with substituting uniFBA8+afii301 with uni06BE
     is fixed.

These fonts are expected to work just as fine as the original X Series 2 fonts
released by Behnam at irmug.com. A sample of all fonts are included in
'HM_FTX-fonts-sample.pdf' file. If the fonts are installed correctly, you can
recreate the fonts sample by invoking the command:
"xelatex HM_FTX-fonts-sample.tex".

Any comments or suggestions would be gratefully appreciated. Please use the
persian-hm-ftx issue tracker on Bitbucket to report all bugs, issues or
problems you find in Persian HM-FTX fonts.

I will do my best to fix all the bugs you report, but, unfortunately,
time is a big hurdle to overcome; so, my apologies in advance for those
which I cannot make time to fix.
